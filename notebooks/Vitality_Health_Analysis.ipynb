    "- **Peak Prevalence:** According to the data, the majority of patients fall within the age groups of 50 to 90 years.  \n",
    "- **Highest Patient Count:** The largest number of patients is reported in the **[70–80)** age group (over approximately 25,000).  \n",
    "- **Lowest Prevalence:** The number of patients in younger age groups ([0–10) and [10–20)) is minimal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Clinical Complexity  \n",
    "- The high prevalence in older age groups (70–90) suggests that these patients may suffer from multiple comorbidities in addition to diabetes.  \n",
    "- Although the number of patients aged over 90 is relatively small, their health conditions are highly complex, requiring specialized post-hospital care services.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Strategic Recommendations  \n",
    "- **Geriatric Care:** Since a large proportion of patients are elderly, nursing staff should receive additional training in geriatric care services.  \n",
    "- **Resource Allocation:** Given the high patient count in the 70–80 age group, hospital bed capacity and medication supply should be optimized to meet the needs of this demographic.  \n",
    "- **Readmission Risk:** Older patients have a higher probability of readmission. Therefore, before discharge, greater attention should be paid to ensuring their clinical stability.  "

    "- **Disease Severity:** Insulin is typically prescribed for patients with more complex conditions or those whose blood glucose levels cannot be adequately controlled with oral medications. The higher readmission rate among insulin users reflects the greater severity of their disease.  \n",
    "- **Glycemic Control:** Insulin users face a higher risk of sudden fluctuations in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia), which contributes to their increased likelihood of readmission.  \n",

    "- **Targeted Monitoring:** Before discharge, insulin users should receive specialized counseling on dosage management and proper administration techniques.  \n",
